                            <p>Hi, I'm an aspiring game programmer.</p>
                            <p>I'm currently a year 4 student majoring in Computer Science (and minoring in Interactive Media Development) at National University of Singapore. My focus area is mostly on interactive media/games and graphics. I also have an interest in UI/UX design, and thus very much enjoy doing front-end web development.</p>
                            <p>My biggest hobby, as you can probably already tell, is art. I began taking my art seriously around 8 years ago, and have been giving most of my free time to it. It is hands down my favourite thing to do.</p>
                            <p>I also love music, and enjoy playing Final Fantasy pieces on the piano from time to time. I sometimes try to compose music of my own, but have failed miserably so far. Nonetheless, it is something I want to be able to do eventually, as I hope to be able to make an entire game on my own someday.</p>
                            <p>Needless to say, the rest of my free time is spent playing games.</p>
